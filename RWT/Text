There once was a teenager named Cruz. He found his passion at the start of sophomore year in highschool: coding. Eventually Cruz got so good at coding
that everyone feared his coding skillz except his master Rory~goshojinsama and friend Grant~sama. Cruz made many friends with his mad skillz and 
ended his sophomore year with a grin on his face.
